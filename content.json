We propose several hypotheses regarding the effect of DEX and find evidence consistent with a learning channel. That is, investors trust the DEX: DEX’s userbase information affects investor trading on the centralized cryptocurrency exchange (CEX). This effect intensifies during instances of market manipulation––“wash trading”—on the CEX or when investors have more concerns about it. Conversely, CEX’s userbase doesn’t reciprocally impact CEX trading. Using the “yield-farming” program launch as quasi-exogenous shocks, we confirm DEX’s causal impact on CEX trading. Our study highlights that the DEX can foster efficient, transparent trading structures where trustworthy centralized mechanisms are impractical or costly.SSRN Link","link":"/2025/01/07/hello-world/"}],"tags":[],"categories":[]}
